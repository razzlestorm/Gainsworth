# Contributing to Gainsworth

We're delighted that you would like to contribute to Gainsworth. The first step
is to follow the steps below the Github Flow section. For branch naming, decide 
if you would like to create a `feature`, `bugfix`, `tests`, or something else, 
and name your branch by prepending one of these. An example might be something
like `feature-weight-tracker`, or `tests-exercise-reminder`. 

To learn a bit about Gainsworth and Discord Bot `Cogs`, take a look at the 
`example.py` file in `gainsworth/cogs`. These are the basic components of a cog,
which can be activated when the Gainsworth bot is started. Typically, each cog
should provide some unique "single responsibility" functionality, and you can
think Gainsworth as the sum of its cogs. For more information on cogs, please
see the [documentation](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ext/commands/cogs.html).

Once you have fully fleshed out your idea in code, continue following the steps
below, including running tests to make sure that everything still works. Feel
free to add tests to your Cog and/or new functions, to make sure that everything
plays together well, then submit the pull request. Once your PR has been
approved and merged into the `main` branch, your changes should be reflected
in Gainsworth almost immediately!

As always, reach out with any questions at all!

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as
accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use
[Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We
actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be
under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that
covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by
